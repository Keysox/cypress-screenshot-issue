This repository reproduces a bug with cypress taking screenshots of an element that's being scaled over time. To reproduce, start the app by installing dependencies via `yarn install` and start the app with `yarn start`. To launch cypress, simply `cypress:open` and run `spec.js`. You'll notice the test fail with an exception coming from cypress.
